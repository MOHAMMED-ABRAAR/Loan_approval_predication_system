Loan Prediction Model
Overview
This project is a loan prediction model that uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset of loan applications and uses a combination of logistic regression and random forest algorithms to make predictions.

Features
The model uses the following features to make predictions:
Applicant income
Coapplicant income
Loan amount
Gender
Marital status
Dependents
Education
Self-employment status
Property area
The model also uses feature engineering to create a new feature, Total_Income, which is the sum of applicant and coapplicant incomes.
Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using classification report and accuracy score.
The model is trained and tested on a dataset of loan applications, with a test size of 0.2.
The model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on the test dataset.
Model Interpretation
The model uses SHAP values to interpret the predictions made by the random forest algorithm.
A summary plot is generated to visualize the SHAP values.
Deployment
The model is deployed using Flask, a web development framework.
The model can be accessed through a REST API, where users can send a JSON payload with the feature values and receive a prediction of whether the loan will be approved or rejected.
How to Use
To use the model, send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with a JSON payload containing the feature values.
The model will return a JSON response with the predicted loan status.
